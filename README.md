This plugin does not add any fields to forms. It instead includes in the email all data from fields added to the core contact form when using a custom plugin like that described at http://docs.joomla.org/Adding_custom_fields_to_core_components_using_a_plugin.

Without this plugin, if you add fields to the core contact form, the data submitted in those fields are not included in the email that you receive.
